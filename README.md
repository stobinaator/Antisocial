## Game Play

>You can use the arrows or WASD. </br>
>Use 'ESC' button to terminate the game. </br>
>You can go through the left wall and appear on the right, and vice-versa. </br>
>There are 2 cheats, 'X' - slows enemies. It costs you score tho. </br>

There is a 'highscore.txt' file that is empty, on the first run it will show you that the highscore is 0. </br>
If there is a new highscore, relatively to the highscore gotten from the .txt file, it is going to be overwritten. </br>
