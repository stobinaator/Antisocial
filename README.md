# Antisocial

A game where while I try to duck my friends I also have to collect powerups in the form of lightnings and mushrooms.

## Setup

Best would be to create a new environment with python version >=3.7.7. </br>

1. In the environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt`</br>
2. `python __init__.py`</br>


## Characters

main character
>![](players/player.png) <- me

good girl
>![](players/good/ceci.png) <- different points depending on the image size.

gang of bad brodies

power ups
>![](players/powerups/flash.png) <- randomly +1 or -1 speed
